\item \textbf{Chapter 5, Section 1, Exercise 1 (page 243)}

\item \textbf{Chapter 5, Section 1, Exercise 2 (page 243)}

\item \textbf{Chapter 5, Section 1, Exercise 5 (page 244)}

\item 
   Suppose that you have two fair six-sided die (meaning each side has the same chance of facing up), one red and one blue, and suppose that each roll of the pair is independent.
   Define $X$ to be the sum of the number of dots facing up on a single roll of the pair of die, and define $T$ to be the first roll of the pair of die where the sum of the dots facing up is 7.
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item Complete the following table for the random variable $X$:
         \begin{table}[h]
            \centering
            \begin{tabular}{c|c}
               $x$ & $f(x)$ \\ \hline
               1 & \\
               2 & \\
               3 & \\
               4 & \\
               5 & \\
               6 & \\
               7 & \\
               8 & \\
               9 & \\
               10 & \\
               11 & \\
               12 & \\
               13 & \\ \hline
            \end{tabular}
         \end{table}

      \item If I roll the pair of die 4 times, how many times should I expect the sum of the dots facing up on the two die to be 7? What is the probability that I roll a 7 on three of those 

      \item If I roll the pair of die 6 times, what is the probability that the sum of the dots facing up on the two die will be a 7 on three of those rolls?

      \item Find $P(T \le 5)$.

      \item Find $P(T \ge 2)$.

      \item How many times should I expect to roll the die before I see my first roll of 7.

   \end{enumerate}
   
\newpage

\item Consider a continuously distributed random variable, $W$, with a probability density function given by
   $$
   f(w) = \begin{cases}
      \frac{1}{5(1 - e^{-2})} e^{-w/5} & 0 \le w \le 10 \\

      0 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
   $$
   \begin{enumerate}

      \item Graph the probability density function (carefully labeling important features).

      \item Show that the function $f(w)$ is a valid probability density function (i.e., show that (i) $f(w)$ is non-negative and (ii) $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(w) dw = 1$).
         
      \item Find $P(W \le 2)$
         
      \item Find $P(2 \le W \le 5)$

      \item Find $P(5 \le W \le 10)$

      \item Find $P(2 \le W \le 10)$
      
   \end{enumerate}
