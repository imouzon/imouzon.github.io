\question
An agriculturist is attempting to determine which of three species of corn (A, B, and C) yield the most grain per acre.
Since the yield may depend on the fertilizer used, the researcher intends to use fertilizers with different concentrations of Nitrogen as well - low Nitrogen, medium-low Nitrogen, medium-high Nitrogen, and high Nitrogen.
There are 8 fields (scattered around Iowa) available to perform this expiriment. 
Each field is divided into 24 single acre plots and the combinations of species and fertilizer are randomly assigned so that within each field every combination is used exactly twice.
At harvest time, the amount of grain each plot yields is recorded and the combination of corn species and fertilizer that gives the highest average yield is chosen.

A survey given to members of a national engineering honor society who have recently graduated is attempting to determine the relationship between salary and GPA.
The graph below displays 150 responses.

The results are depicted below (using GPA on the x-axis):

\end{center}

Here are some summaries of the data (again using the actual score as the x-value and the person's evaluation of their score as the y-value):

$$
   \sum_{i=1}^{150} x_i = 487 \hspace{3cm} \sum_{i=1}^{150} x_i^2 = 1609 \\
$$

$$
   \sum_{i=1}^{150} y_i = 11474 \hspace{3cm} \sum_{i=1}^{150} y_i^2 = 882126 \\
$$

$$
   \sum_{i=1}^{150} x_i y_i = 37299
$$

\begin{parts}

\question
O-rings are elastomer loops designed to create a seal between the interface of two parts of a mechanical device.
Because the elasticity of the material used to make them can be impacted by temperature (which can lead to the seal being broken) it is important to make sure that the O-ring is functional at the temperatures the part they are used in will be exposed to.
Two composites (Composite X and Composite Y) are being tested in an O-ring that will be used in a part of a satellite that will be exposed to very low temperatures.
A sample of 50 O-rings from each composite are placed in a chamber, where the temperature is gradually reduced until the seal is broken.
Suppose that each composite has some mean failure temperature, $\mu_X$ for Composite X and $\mu_Y$ for Composite Y, and some variance in failure temperature, 
$\sigma_X^2$ for Composite X and $\sigma_Y^2$ for Composite Y. 
Before any observations are recorded, we can consider the sampled values from Composite X to be random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{50}$ with $\mathbb{E}(X_i) = \mu_X$ and $Var(X_i) = \sigma_X^2$.
We can also consider the sampled values from Composite Y to be random variables $Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_{50}$ with $\mathbb{E}(Y_i) = \mu_Y$ and $Var(Y_i) = \sigma_Y^2$.

Let $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{50} X_1 + \frac{1}{50} X_2 + \ldots + \frac{1}{50} X_{50}$ and let $\bar{Y} = \frac{1}{50} Y_1 + \frac{1}{50} Y_2 + \ldots + \frac{1}{50} Y_{50}$.
