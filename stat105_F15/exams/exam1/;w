\question

The chemically complex paints used to line roads, like many liquids, are routinely shipped by train in tanker cars since it is reasonably quick and cost effecient.
However, once the cars arrive at their destination, they often sit for long periods of time before being released to the client - in the case of paint, this waiting time can cause the different components to separate into layers 
and the paint must be "remixed" before it can be used.
of the mixand the resulting layers must be mixed again at the destination.
A certain city receives shipments of these paints where they are held at the shipping station for a day before being released.
A civil engineer working for the city plans to test the effectiveness of 5 methods of remixing the paint.
Since the primary types of paint (white and yellow) are chemically different it is expected that the effectiveness will differ with type as well.
Additionally, since the tanks themselves are coming from different destinations, 
it is suspected that remixing effectiveness will vary from tank to tank.

There are two tanks of yellow paint and two tanks of white paint being shipped. The engineer devises the following plan.
Here are the details of her plan:

\begin{itemize}
   \item The content of each tank will be divided into 10 parts.
   \item Each part will be randomly assigned an ID from 1 - 10.
   \item Method 1 will be applied to ID 1 and 2, Method 2 will be applied to ID 3 and 4, Method 3 will be applied to ID 5 and 6, Method 4 will be applied to ID 7 and 8, Method 5 will be applied to ID 9 and 10.

An environmental engineer is testing four methods for reducing the concentration of a certain lake pollutant found in Iowa lakes.
To do this he first randomly selected 20 Iowa lakes from which he took water samples,
then split each of the 20 samples into 4 portions, 
and randomly labeled the four portions 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
Finally, he attempted to reduce the concentration of each 
of the portions labeled 1 using the the first method, 
of each of the portions labeled 2 using the second method, 
of each of the portions labeled 3 using the third method, 
and of each of the portions labeled portion 4 using the fourth method. 
After the methods had been applied, he measured the change in concentration. \\

\question

Recently my teenage niece had an opportunity to upgrade her smart phone. 
She narrowed her choices down to two phones (phone A and phone B) but had a hard time making her final decision.
She decided to ask people she knew who had one of the phones to rate their satisfaction from 0\% to 100\%.
She also asked them if they would prefer to have the other phone.
In order to help put their feelings in perspective, she also made note of how negative she thought they were in general, 
using three descriptions: the interviewee was classified as overly critical, appropriately critical, or not critical enough.

The strength of an internet connection is often described in terms of its download speed, measured in megabits per second (or Mbps).
A systems administrator is concerned that recent changes in her company's main server framework may be having a negative impact on the local network's download speed.

\question

The major cause of axel failure in freight trucks is when shippers exceed the recommended weight limits that can be handled by the axels. 
Issues resulting from these failures have been becoming more frequent as shippers try to cut corners, 
leading members of the state's Department of Transportation to ask one of their civil engineers 
to look into the available data and better advise them on the relationship between excessive weight and axel failure.

A company manufacturing axels provides the engineer with data gathered from conducting experiments loading axels with excessive weight and simulating traveling conditions.
The data consists of two columns, \textbf{excessive weight (in tonnes)} is the amount of weight over the limit that was placed on the axel, and 
\textbf{distance to failure (in tens of thousands of miles)} is the simulated distance to the axel's failure. 

%-- : R code (Code in Document)
<<echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, include = TRUE>>=
   options(scipen=999)

   #weight = 2*(.025*1:50)
   
   #failure_time = round(17.5 + 1.5*weight - 9*weight^2 + rnorm(50,0,5),0)

   #write.csv(file = "./axel_break.csv",data.frame(weight,failure_time), row.names=FALSE,quote=FALSE)
   dw <- read.csv("axel_break.csv")

   dw$failure_time <- dw$failure_time + abs(min(dw$failure_time)) + 1

   weight <- dw$weight

   failure_time <- dw$failure_time

@

\begin{center}
<<fig.width=5, fig.height=5, out.width='.5\\linewidth', echo=FALSE>>=
   qplot(weight,failure_time,xlab="Weight Exceeding Guidelines (in tonnes)",ylab="Travel Distance to Failure (10,000 miles)") + coord_fixed(.05)
@
\end{center}

Here are some summaries of the data:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{50} x_i = \Sexpr{round(sum(weight))} \hspace{3cm} \sum_{i=1}^{50} x_i^2 = \Sexpr{round(sum(weight^2))} \\
$$

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{50} y_i = \Sexpr{round(sum(failure_time))} \hspace{3cm} \sum_{i=1}^{50} y_i^2 = \Sexpr{round(sum(failure_time^2))} \\
$$

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{50} x_i y_i = \Sexpr{round(sum(failure_time*weight))}
$$

\begin{parts}
   \part Using the summaries above, fit a linear relationship between \textbf{weight exceeding guidelines} (x) and \textbf{travel distance to failure} (y). 
   \begin{subparts}
      \subpart[5] Write the equation of the fitted linear relationship.
