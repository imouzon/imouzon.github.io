\question

An engineer for City Bikes, a rent-and-return bike company, is working on decreasing the time it takes to bring a bicycle to a complete halt.
The company is interested in fitting bikes with brake that is has consistently short brake times. 
Bike mechanisms are durable and rarely wear out, but the rubber brake pads often do and may be replaced locally (i.e., the type of brake pad used is out of the company's control, but the brand of brake mechanism is within their control).
His goal is to recommend a brake mechanism that has low stopping times regardless of the brake pads used.
He is looking at three different brands of brake mechanism and three common types of rubber brake pads and has decided to use a factorial study to determine which brake mechanism is best.
The engineer assigns the brake mechanism brand to Factor A and the rubber pads to Factor B. 
Stopping speeds for each combination of brake mechanism and brake pads were tested four times under similar condtions.

The results are recorded below.

\question 


After winning an enormous sum on a (rigged) casino dice game Danny Ocean moves on to another game.
In roullette, a ball bounces on a spinning wheel with 38 pockets numbered 0, 00, 1, 2, ..., 36, and bets are made on which pocket the ball will eventually come to rest. 
In a fair game, the ball has the same chance of coming to a rest in every pocket, but Mr. Ocean has rigged the game (using metallic dust and magnets).
In this rigged version, the ball will come to rest in 00 with probability 0.14, 0 with probability 0.14, and any other of the 36 pockets with probability 0.02.
Mr. Ocean will win his bet if the ball lands in either 00 or 0. 

He defines two random variables: $X$ (which takes the value 1 if he wins the first spin and 0 if he loses), and $T$, the number of attempts needed to win for the first time. \\

\begin{parts}

   \part[2] Provide the probability function for $X$.

   \part[2] What is the probability that Danny will win for the first time on his 5th attempt?
   \vspace{3cm}

   \part[4] What is the probability that it will take more than 2 games for Danny to win his first bet?
   \vspace{3cm}

   \part[4] Danny wins, but decides to play five more games - what is the probability that he wins at least one of them?

     \subpart[2] $P(Z \le 2)$

     \vspace{2cm}

     \subpart[2] $P(|Z| \ge 1)$

     \vspace{2cm}

     \vspace{2cm}

     \subpart[2] $P(|X| \le 4.5)$

     \vspace{2cm}

  \end{subparts}

  \part[5] Find the value $a$ so that $P(- a + 2 < X < a + 2) = .95$ (approximate as needed).

\question

$$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
    0 &  x < 0 \\
    c x^2 &  -2  < x < 2 \\
    0 & x \ge 2
\end{cases}
$$
where $c$ is a constant.

\begin{parts}

\part[2] What is the value of $c$ if $f(x)$ is a valid probability density function?

\question

Suppose we know that $W$ is a binomial random variable with $n = 5$ trials, 
each with the same probability of success $p$, but that the value of $p$ is depends on another random variable $X$.
$X$ will take one of three values, $\frac{1}{4}$, $\frac{2}{4}$, or $\frac{3}{4}$, each with the same probability.
The value $X$ takes will then serve as the value for the probability of success, $p$, for $W$, i.e., if $X = \frac{1}{4}$ then $W$ is a Binomial(5,$\frac{1}{4}$). 
Two of the conditional probability functions that result from this arrangement are below:
$$
f(w|X = \frac{1}{4}) = 
\begin{cases}
   \frac{5!}{(5-w)! w!} (\frac{1}{4})^w (1 - \frac{1}{4})^{5 - w} & w = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \text{ or } 5 \\
   0 &  \text{ otherwise }
\end{cases}
f(w|X = \frac{2}{4}) = 
\begin{cases}
   \frac{5!}{(5-w)! w!} (\frac{2}{4})^w (1 - \frac{2}{4})^{5 - w} & w = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \text{ or } 5 \\
   0 &  \text{ otherwise }
\end{cases}
$$

In this problem, $f(x,w) = P(X = x, Y = y)$ defines the joint probability function.
\begin{parts}
   \part[2] Find the conditional probability function $f(w | X = \frac{3}{4})$.
   \vspace{2cm}
   \part[2] Find the joint probability $f(\frac{1}{4},0)$.
   \vspace{2cm}
   \part[2] Find the joint probability $f(\frac{2}{4},0)$.
   \vspace{2cm}
   \part[3] Find $f_{W}(0)$.
   \vspace{2cm}
   \part[2] Find $f_{X|W}(\frac{1}{4}|W = 0)$.
   \vspace{2cm}
   \part[2] Find $P(X = \frac{2}{4}|W = 0)$.
   \vspace{2cm}
   \part[2] Find $P(X = \frac{3}{4}|W = 0)$.
   \vspace{2cm}
   \part (\textit{5 bonus points}) If we don't know what value $X$ has taken, but we can observe the value of $W$, what values can $W$ take that would make us believe it is more likely that $X = \frac{2}{4}$ than either of the other two values of $X$?
