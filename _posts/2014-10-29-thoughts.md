#Principal components for data reduction

One of the common approaches used when working with big data is 
reducing the number of features through a principal component analysis.
Since it is an unsupervised method though, it may not be a great choice in many 
circumstances. Consider the simple example below
<!-- pca: R code (No Results in Document) -->







This creates a data set with 100 feature dimensions and a binary classification.
However, we create the data so that there is a simple relationship between the
classes and the first two features, x1 and x2.

<!-- class: R plot (results in document) -->
![plot of chunk class](../images/class1.png) ![plot of chunk class](../images/class2.png) 


However, with 98 other features to search through, it may be difficult to
identify this relationship immediately, and initially working with this data
we may hope to reduce the data. 

##Principal Components for data reduction

One popular method for data reduction is principal components. 
Consider a data set with each of p features arranged as columns 
of a matrix (giving us an n by p matrix, where n is the number of obsercations the
features are generated by).  We may wish to The basic assumption is 
that for a feature matrix of dimension n by p we can make a set of features 
that the data is and we could build a simple model to capture this behavior:

You may have noticed the data in this case is not comple
