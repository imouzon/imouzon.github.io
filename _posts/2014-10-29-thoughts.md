One of the common approaches used when working with big data is 
reducing the number of features through a principal component analysis.
Since it is an unsupervised method though, it may not be a great choice in many 
circumstances. Consider the simple example below





```r
# select the rows and columns
n = 1000
p = 100

# generate X
X = matrix(rnorm(n * p), nrow = n)

# random correlation matrix
R = randomCovMat(p)

# Give the features some correlation structure
X = data.frame(X %*% R)

# name the columns
names(X) = paste0("x", 1:p)

# add the response to our data
X$y = as.factor(1 * (X$x1 < 0 & X$x2 < 0) | (X$x1 > 0 & X$x2 > 0))
X$y = as.factor(1 * (X$x1 < 0.8 * X$x2))
```

This creates a data set with 100 feature dimensions and a binary classification.
However, we create the data so that there is a simple relationship between the
classes and the first two features, x1 and x2.

<!-- class: R plot (results in document) -->

```r
   qplot(x1,x2,color=y,data=X)
```

```r
   qplot(x1,x100,color=y,data=X)
```

However, with 98 other features to search through, it may be difficult to
identify this relationship immediately, and initially working with this data
we may hope to reduce the data. 

##Principal Components for data reduction

One popular method for data reduction is principal components. 
Consider a data set with each of p features arranged as columns 
of a matrix (giving us an n by p matrix, where n is the number of obsercations the
features are generated by).  We may wish to The basic assumption is 
that for a feature matrix of dimension n by p we can make a set of features 
that the data is and we could build a simple model to capture this behavior:

You may have noticed the data in this case is not comple

```r
   Xmat = as.matrix(X[,1:p])
   rm=rowMeans(Xmat)
   Xnew= Xmat - matrix(rep(rm, ncol(Xmat)), nrow=nrow(Xmat))

   A = Xnew%*%t(Xnew)
   E = eigen(A,TRUE)
   P=t(E$vectors)
   P.X = data.frame(P%*%Xnew)
   names(P.X) = paste0('PC',1:p)
   P.X$y = X$y
```
