This is not my first blog post. 
I have had at least 3 start/stop blogs in the recent past.
I think this one will have a longer shelf life though for two reasons: first 
I know that I need to write in order to get better at writing; and second I know that I need
to get better at writing. 
The simple goal of writing to write will hopefully be enough to fill 
this webpage with useful material.

## The Future
I intend to get a domain name very soon but for the moment I will be very happy 
just to keep everything on github.
