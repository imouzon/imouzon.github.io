My name is Ian Mouzon. I am a graduate student studying statistics at Iowa State University. 
I am interested in many facets of statistics, but I am happiest when I can work with complex and preferably large data sets which allow me to think of unique ways to build models. This is my CV:

# I have other interests too
* Statistical programming: SAS, R - I wrote [SASnatch](https://github.com/imouzon/SASnatch), 
  a package that allows the two languages to work together through knitr.
* Data mining: I have been on two data mining cup teams (5th place in 2013, 
  1st place in 2014) and enjoy the skills the constraints of competition 
  helps to develop.
* Film: I love classic and independent films, which may be a byproduct of how I grew up.
