My name is Ian Mouzon. I am a graduate student studying statistics at Iowa State University. 
I am interested in many facets of statistics, 
but I am happiest when I can work with complex and preferably large data sets which allow 
me to think of unique ways to build models.

# I have other interests too
* Statistical programming: SAS, R - I wrote [SASnatch](https://github.com/imouzon/SASnatch), 
  a package that allows the two languages to work together through knitr.
* Data mining: I have been on two data mining cup teams (5th place in 2012, 
  1st place in 2013) and enjoy the skills the constraints of competition 
  helps to develop.
* Film: I love classic and independent films, which may be a byproduct of how I grew up.
  I remember feeling like I got there just before the "indie than thou" sentiment
  started. At the moment, I look forward to films by [Joe Swanberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_Buddies), [Ti West](https://twitter.com/Ti_West), and [Whit Stillman](http://www.firstthings.com/article/2010/12/whit-stillman-is-running-late).
  I can also love a good [pop](http://vimeo.com/105540136) [movies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVt32qoyhi0)
