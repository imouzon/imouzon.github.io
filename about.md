My name is Ian Mouzon. I am a graduate student studying statistics at Iowa State University. 
I am interested in many facets of statistics, 
but I am happiest when I can work with complex and preferably large data sets which allow 
me to think of unique ways to build models.

# I have other interests too
* Statistical programming: SAS, R - I wrote [SASnatch](https://github.com/imouzon/SASnatch) a package that allows the two languages to work together through knitr.
* Data mining: I have been on two data mining cup teams (5th place in 2012, 1st place in 2013) and enjoy the new skills the constraints of competition force me to pick up.
