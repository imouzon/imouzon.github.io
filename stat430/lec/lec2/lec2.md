## The Probabilistic Framework 

-  A random experiment in which the outcome is not known prior to observation

-  A Sample Space containing all possible outcomes of the experiment

## Events

-  Events are subsets of the sample space

-  _Elementary events_ are subsets of size 1, i.e., they are individual outcomes

## Probability

-  A function whose domain is the events and whose range is \\([0,1]\\)

_example:_ flipping coins, tossing die
