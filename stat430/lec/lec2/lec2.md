## Sample Spaces

-  A sample space is a set of all possible outcomes

-  Sample spaces can range greatly in complexity

-  Sample spaces can be **finite**, **countably infinite**, or **uncountably infinite**

## Events

-  Events are subsets of the sample space

-  _Elementary events_ are subsets of size 1, i.e., they are individual outcomes

## Probability

-  A function whose domain is the events and whose range is \\([0,1]\\)

_example:_ flipping coins, tossing die
