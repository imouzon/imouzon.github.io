# Welcome

Welcome to the supplemental course page for Fall 2015 STAT 105 section B.

## Purpose of this Page
While the course will generally be run through [blackboard](https://bb.its.iastate.edu/), some content can be better shared here (for instance, lecture demonstrations).
I will be very careful to draw your attention here if and when we make use of this page.
