   <h2> What Do Engineers Do? </h2>

-  Design/build/operate/improve some system

-  Use both **quantitative theories** (i.e., mathematical) and **scientific principles** (i.e., physics, chemistry, psychology(?)) as a guide

-  Obvious issue - math/science vast, no one knows everything. 

-  Additionally, engineers must work outside of "lab conditions" - there is no control over the environment, the users, the timing, ...

# So, here's the situation:
## The "system" you want to improve is essentially unique 
## There are competing theories that all seem equal
## Experts disagree bitterly about what to do 
# What's an engineer to do???
---
#Option 1: Just Give Up

## A few drawbacks to this one
---
#Option 2: Gather Some Data

## Figure Out What Really Matters in the System

## What Do I Mean Data?

Data is **essentially just information** we can record.

Examples are incredibly easy to come up with:

-  Students with majors and courses they enrolled in
```
student   major         course
John      Philosophy    EASY 101
Kate      Engineering   SMRT 500
Mike      Mathematics   MATH 000
```

-  "Thrust Face Runouts" and load method for gears in in a continuous carburizing furnace (Chapter 1, Example 1)
```
Method    Thrust Face Runouts
Laid      5, 8, 8,  9,  9,  9,  9, 10, 10, ..., 19, 27
Hung      7, 8, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11, 11, ..., 31, 36
```

## Engineering Statistics

Collecting good data is part of what engineering statistics is concerned with, 
but of course that's only the first part.

Our text book defines it this way:

> **Engineering Statistics** is the study of how *best* to
>
> 1. Collect engineering data
> 2. summarize or describe engineering data, and
> 3. draw formal inferences and practical conclusions on the basis of engineering data
>
> all while recognizing the reality of variation

The "reality of variation" in the Thrust Face Runouts data:
```
Method    Thrust Face Runouts
Laid      5, 8, 8,  9,  9,  9,  9, 10, 10, ..., 19, 27
Hung      7, 8, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11, 11, ..., 31, 36
```
<!--- chunk-label: R code (No Results in Document) -->
```{r cache=FALSE, width=10,height=5}
library(ggplot2)
laid <- c(5,8,8,9,9,9,9,10,10,10,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,12,12,12,12,13,13,13,13,14,14,14,15,15,15,15,16,17,17,18,19,27)
hung <- c(7,8,8,10,10,10,10,11,11,11,12,13,13,13,15,17,17,17,17,18,19,19,20,21,21,21,22,22,22,23,23,23,23,24,27,27,28,31,36)
d <- data.frame(type = c(rep("laid",length(laid)),rep("hung",length(hung))), runout = c(laid,hung))
ggplot(data = d, aes(x=runout,fill= type)) + geom_dotplot(method='histodot',bitwidth=1) + facet_grid(type~.)
```
