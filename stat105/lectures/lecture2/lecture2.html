## Types of Data Structures

The most basic way to think about data is to imagine how the the raw observations could be organized once collected.

Collected data can be referred to as a **data set**. 
If the data set is simple enough, we can store it in a **data table** or **flat file**.
Traditional data tables store values relating to a single observation/unit/individual as a row of the table.
Each column in the table represents a value for some observed characterstic observed.

**Example**: Failure time of lightbulbs

A single brand and model of lightbulb is being examined for average failure time.
Five bulbs were run until they burned out and their lifetime was recorded in hours.
The first bult lasted 521.4 hours, the second bulb lasted 501.2 hours, 
the third bulb lasted 541.8 hours,
the fourth bulb lasted 498.1 hours,
and the fifth bulb lasted 528.2 hours.

**Example**: Failure time of lightbulbs, continued

Assembling the results in a data table could look like this:

```text
Bulb Number       Failure Time (hours)
1                 521.4
2                 501.2
3                 541.8
4                 498.1
5                 528.2
```

Each bulb tested gets its own row - which row is attached to which bulb is identified by the first column.
The only feature being observed is failure time - so only one column of observations are recorded for each bulb.

Notice: 

-  Failure Time is a **quantitative continuous** variable. 
-  This is a **univariate data set**.

## Types of Data Structures

The complexity of our data we gather changes based on our objective.  Consider the following scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Simple Data Structure**

We have designed a less expensive method for cleaning the byproduct of our production process. What constitutes clean is determined by law.

-  Our data will consist of a simply measure of cleanliness after treatment with the new method.

**Scenario 2: Complex Data Structure**

Synthesis of a certain chemical can be done in a number of ways. We are considering two sets of substrates, three environments where production can occur, and three chemists to perform the synthesis. Our goal is to get the purest end product.

-  We must gather data on substrate, environment, the chemist's identity, and the resulting purity.

## Factorial Studies

>  **Factorial Studies** involve scenarios in which several process variables are indentified as being of interest and data are collected under possible combinations of these scenarios.

>  **Complete Factorial Studies** are factorial studies where data is collected from each possible combination of the process variables 

>  **Partial Factorial Studies** are factorial studies where data is collected from each possible combination of the process variables 

>  We call the process variables **factors** and the settings we examine them at **levels**

   <h2> Factorial Studies Example </h2>
   <img src="www/figs/two_chemists_trim.jpg" alt="dmc logo" height="125"> 
</center>

>  A pair of chemists, [Walter and Jessie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQR1r1KTjaE), are attempting to synthesize a chemical and consider purity to be the most important quality in the product. There are three environments available to them (Winnebago/Basement/Lab) and two precursors (pseudoephedrine/methylamine). They are both willing to take either the role of "lead cook" and will try all their options in order to get the best results.

-  What are the factors and factor levels being examined here?

-  How many combinations of the factor levels are there?
]

lead cook - Walter, Jessie
environment - winnebago, basement, lab
precursor - pseudo, methylamine

2 x 3 x 2 = 12

WRITE OUT THE LEVELS AFTER SOME TIME FOR THEM TO WRITE THEM OUT

After testing each scenario, Walter and Jessie decide that the best combination to use is Walt as cook in the lab with methylamine.
However, a new "chemist" Victor has joined the group and is going to try to be the cook and "follow the recipe" in the lab.
Jessie also tries a new environment, South America, where only methylamine is available.

-  If we consider all the past levels to be part of this new study, how many combinations of factor levels are now possible?

-  Victor never works in the Winnebago, the basement, or South America. Walter never works in South America. What kind of study is this?

## Mathematical Models and Data Analysis

>  **Mathematical Model**: A description of a physical system using mathematical concepts and language.

Identifying mathematical relationships between parts of a system allows us to describe complexity in simple terms.  

**Example**: Height of an Object in Projectile Motion

We can describe the relationship between height of a projectile \\(y\\) and time \\(t\\) as
\\[
y  = h_0 + v_h \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2, \text{ } t \ge 0,
\\]
where 
- \\(h_0\\) is the initial height,
- \\(v_h\\) is the initial vertical velocity,
and
- \\(g\\) is the (constant) acceleration due to gravity

**Example**: Height of an Object in Projectile Motion, cont.

\\[
y  = h_0 + v_h \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2, \text{   } t \ge 0,
\\]

However, this is not what we see in real life for a variety of reasons. This model assumes

1. \\(g\\) is constant, while \\(g\\) is actually a function of distance between the objects which changes,

2. \\(g\\) is known, while it is actually estimated and approximated,

3. Gravity is the only force acting on the object, ignoring drag force, electrical attractions, etc.

4. There are no other changes in the system (for instance, changes in air pressure)

We can fix these by writing a better relationship *or* we can accept that some things won't be known and use a **stochastic model** - a mathematical model that specifically allows for variation (or "randomness").
Understanding how these **stochastic models** work is a major focus of this course.
