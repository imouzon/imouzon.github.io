We described an ideal simple experiment and defined terms associated with one (2.3.1, 2.3.2)
-  response, managed variable, controlled variable, experimental variable, concomitant variable, extraneous variable, blocking variable, and randomization

We discussed the importance of **Comparative studies** (2.3.3)
-  there are many things that we can not control when we make measurements and collect data
-  when we want to compare a new method to a previous method, we need to be aware that the uncontrolled circumstances that existed when we studied the previous method do not exist anymore
-  in order to *know* that differences in results are the result of the method used (and not the difference in the circumstances) we must collect new data on both methods

### Dealing With Extraneous Variables

Some aspects of the environment can not be controlled, even though they may effect the results we see. We call those aspects **extraneous variables**.

Though we can not *control* extraneous variables, we can plan our experiment to minimize their impact (2.3.2, 2.3.4)

**blocking** 

-  the process of arranging the experiment so that results from different methods are collected in similar environments

-  with blocking, we can compare methods in multiple environments

**randomization** 

-  the process of randomly assigning experimental units to experimental conditions *not already controlled by the specification of the supervised variables*

-  we hope to remove any pattern that the extraneous variables may have

-  Weight lifting example: 50 pound, 40 pound, 30 pound dumb bell, 100 lifts each, determining which is harder to lift by how much you strain

### Dealing With Extraneous Variables, cont.

**Replication** 

-  the process of repeating a run of the experiment more than once

-  the results I get on the first run should be similar to the results I get on the second run

-  replication is strongly connected to the concept of reproducibility - the results I get should be similar to the results you get

### Summary

The main point is this: an effective experiment is designed to account for the environmental conditions that could influence our response.
Doing this takes a lot of planning.

### Completely Randomized
]
.right-column[
With **replication**, **randomization**, **blocking** we have introduced some common elements used in planning an experiment. 
Common combinations of these elements make up "skeleton" experiments around which we can build our real-life experiments.

**Completely Randomized Experiments**

-  All experimental variables are of primary interest (no controls, no blocking)

-  Randomization used at every possible point where we choose how to treat the experimental units

**Examples**

-  Example 12 (page 51): Golf ball drive distances study by G.Gronberg

   -  10 balls each at 3 different compressions (80, 90, and 100)

   -  How would you design an experiment to determine which type can be driven the furthest?

-  Example 13 (page 51-52): Pelletizing experiment

**Randomized Complete Block Experiments**

-  At least on factor is a blocking variable 

-  "Blocks" are created by combinations of the levels of the blocking variables

-  Within each block, every combination of the primary experimental variables are used at least once

-  Randomization is used where possible

**Examples**

-  Example 12 (page 51): Golf ball drive distances study by G.Gronberg

   -  Gronberg didn't drive the golf balls all at the same time 

   -  instead, he personally drove 10 golf balls from each compression each night, 6 nights a week, for 3 weeks.

**Randomized Incomplete Block Experiments**

-  At least on factor is a blocking variable 

-  "Blocks" are created by combinations of the levels of the blocking variables

-  Within each block, some combinations (but not all) of the primary experimental variables are used at least once while others are not used at all

-  Randomization is used where possible

**How does this work??**

-  There are some clever ways to assign the combinations of the primary experimental variable levels to the blocks that allow us to get "more" out of the data we collect.

-  How these block assignments come about gets explained in Chapter 8.

# Your Turn
## Drill Bits Experiment
---
layout:false
<center> <h1> A Simple Experiment </h1> </center>

One step in manufacturing a simple product involves drilling holes in a piece of metal. 
The bits used in this process are expensive and eventually wear out. 
Fortunately there are three brands that could be used. 
We would like to determine which brand is the most wear resistant.
We will do this generally, by drilling a bunch of holes in pieces of sheet metal and then checking the bit to see how much wear there is.

---
layout:false
<center> <h1> A Simple Experiment </h1> </center>

Here are our available resources:

-  15 bits from each brand (brand 1, brand 2, and brand 3)
-  as many sheets of metal as we **need** (each sheet can be drilled up to 10000 times)
-  up to 3 mechanics to drill the holes

The floor manager has given us the following input:

-  It takes about 500 presses for the drill bits to begin to reveal how they will wear
-  No two sheets of metal are exactly the same - the thickness varies slightly across each sheet
-  No two workers drill the same - though they have been instructed to be as consistent as possible
-  This process can be completed in one day

### Your Task
Fully describe an experiment that could be put into practice. Describe any blocking, randomization, and repetition.
