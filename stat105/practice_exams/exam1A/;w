\question

An environmental engineer is testing four methods for reducing the concentration of a certain lake pollutant found in Iowa lakes.
To do this he first randomly selected 20 Iowa lakes from which he took water samples,
then split each of the 20 samples into 4 portions, 
and randomly labeled the four portions 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
Finally, he attempted to reduce the concentration of each 
of the portions labeled 1 using the the first method, 
of each of the portions labeled 2 using the second method, 
of each of the portions labeled 3 using the third method, 
and of each of the portions labeled portion 4 using the fourth method. 
After the methods had been applied, he measured the change in concentration. \\

\question

Recently my teenage niece had an opportunity to upgrade her smart phone. 
She narrowed her choices down to two phones (phone A and phone B) but had a hard time making her final decision.
She decided to ask people she knew who had one of the phones to rate their satisfaction from 0\% to 100\%.
She also asked them if they would prefer to have the other phone.
In order to help put their feelings in perspective, she also made note of how negative she thought they were in general, 
using three descriptions: the interviewee was classified as overly critical, appropriately critical, or not critical enough. 

\begin{parts}

The strength of an internet connection is often described in terms of its download speed, measured in megabits per second (or Mbps).
A systems administrator is concerned that recent changes in her company's main server framework may be having a negative impact on the local network's download speed.
Every 2 minutes for an hour, she recorded the network speed at that moment and collected her results into the following stem-and-leaf plot:

<<cache=FALSE, echo = FALSE, comment = NA, include = TRUE>>=

   stem(samp,scale=2)

Note that \verb!0 | 9! represents 0.9. In this case, the first quartile is $Q(.25) = \Sexpr{Qfun(samp,.25)}$, the median is \Sexpr{Qfun(samp,.5)}, and the IQR is \Sexpr{IQRange(samp)}.
