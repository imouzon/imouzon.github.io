\item 
   Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are two independent random variables with probability density functions given by:
   $$
   f_X(x) = 
   \begin{cases}
      5 e^{5x} & x > 0 \\
      0 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
   $$
   and
   $$
   f_Y(y) = 
   \begin{cases}
      2 e^{2y} & y > 0 \\
      0 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
   $$
   respectively.

   Further, define random variable $U$ as
   $$
   U = 
   \begin{cases}
      1 & Y > X \\
      0 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
   $$
   Meaning that if the observed value of the random variable $Y$ is larger than the observed value of the random variable $X$ then $U = 1$ and if the observed value of the random variable $X$ is larger than the observed value of the random variable $Y$ then $U = 0$.

   \begin{enumerate}
      \item Sketch the pdf of $X$ and $Y$ on the same plot. Include the points when the input is 0, 5, and 10 for each function.
      \item Find the probability that $X$ is greater than 3.
      \item Find the probability that $Y$ is greater than 3.
      \item Provide the joint probability of $(X, Y)$.
      \item Find the probability that $U = 1$.
   \end{enumerate}

\item 
   Suppose that $Z_1, Z_2, \ldots, Z_n$ are $n$ independent standard normal random variables.
   It may be helpful to recall that $\mathbb{E}(a Z_i + b) = a \mathbb{E}(Z_i) + b$ and that $\text{Var}(a Z_i + b) = a^2 + \text{Var}(Z_i)$ for any constants $a, b$ in addition to knowing that $\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$.

   \begin{enumerate}
   \item 
      Find the expected value of variance of $X$ where $X = 3 Z_1 + 5$

   \item 
      Find the expected value of variance of $Y$ where $Y = Z_1 - Z_2$

   \item 
      Find the expected value of variance of $U$ where $U = Z_1 - Z_1$

   \item 
      Find the expected value of variance of $W$ where $W = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{i}{n} \left(Z_i + \frac{i}{n}\right)$.
   \end{enumerate}
