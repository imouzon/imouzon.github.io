\item \textbf{Chapter 5, Section 2, Exercise 4 (page 263)}

 
\item Suppose that the cumulative probability function (cdf)
of the the magnitude, $X$, of a dynamic load on a bridge (in newtons) is given by
$$
F(x) = \begin{cases}
     0 & x < 0 \\
     \dfrac{x}{8} + \dfrac{3}{16}x^2 & 0 \leq x \leq 2\\
     1 & 2 < x
\end{cases}
$$

\item What is the probability that the load exceeds 1 newton?

\item What is the probability that the load is at most .5 newtons?

\item What is the probability that the load is between 1 and 1.5 newtons.

 \item (\textit{This problem is worth 5 bonus points})
    We know that the probability density function of a normal random variable with $\mathbb{E}(X) = \mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ can be written as
    $$
    f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{1}{2 \sigma^2 } (x - \mu)^2}, -\infty < x < \infty
    $$
    and we also know that, as with any random variable, 
    $$
    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx  = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{1}{2 \sigma^2 } (x - \mu)^2} dx  = 1
    $$

    Using the last fact, to find the value of $ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{3x -x^2} dx $
