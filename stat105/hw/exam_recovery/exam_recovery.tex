This is the document you need to turn in along with you're graded exam. 

\begin{table}[h]
   \centering
   \begin{tabular}{c >{\centering}m{5cm} }
      \hline 
       & \\
      Problem number you are redoing & \\
       & \\
       & \\
      Previous scored on this problem & \\
       & \\
      \hline 
   \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The details for recovery are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item You may choose any problem from the exam and redo it.
   \item The points you earned \textit{on the exam during the exam time} will be replaced with the points you earn on this resubmission.
      For example, if you earned 9/15 on problem 7 and resubmit that problem earning 14/15 then your exam grade will increase by 5 points.

   \item You're exam score can only improve.

   \item Since you are replacing the previous score, you must resubmit your old exam along with the corrected solutions.
      
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Fill in the following table}

Show \textbf{all} of your work on this recovery and answer each part fully in the given context. \\

\emph{Please} staple your assignment! \\
