# Previous Announcements

These are announcements whose usefulness has passed, stored here for completeness sake [(return to course page)](https://imouzon.github.io/stat105).

## January 12, 2016

Welcome to the course page for STAT 105: Intro to Stat Engineering. 
Grades and a few other important parts of the course will be run through [blackboard](https://bb.its.iastate.edu/), but most content can be better shared here (for instance, lecture notes and illustrations).
The page will be updated frequently (though I will make a more clear announcement if there are any changes which you would want to be aware of immediately).
