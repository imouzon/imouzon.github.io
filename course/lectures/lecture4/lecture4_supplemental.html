<center> <h1> The Drill Bits Experiment </h1> </center>

Comply With Standards (CWS) is a company that manufactures after market generic parts for construction machinery. 

A common step in the manufacture of these parts involves drilling holes in a piece of metal. 
As one would expect, as time passes the drill bits begin to wear out and eventually need to be replaced. 
The bits used are relatively expensive and CWS would prefer to use a brand that would last as long as possible.
They are currently using bits produced by LeadBits.

The Better Bits Company (BBC), a rival of LeadBits, sees an opportunity to demonstrate the superiority of their bit.

They have a manufacturing laboratory and the following materials: 

-  Four partially automated drill presses,
-  15 bits produced by LeadBits
-  15 bits produced by BBC
-  30 metal sheets capable of being drilled 100,000 times each

Their human resources consist of:

-  Four workers who have training and experience operating the drill presses and documenting the wear on a drill bit

We also know the following:

-  With the bit and the sheet metal loaded on the press, the workers on average drill 15 holes per minute.
-  It takes on average 5 minutes to change a drill bit,
-  It takes on average 15 minutes to document the wear on a drill bit,

In terms of a bits lifetime, we can generally assume

-  A bit should begin showing wear by 1,000 uses,
-  A bit should have significant wear by 20,000 uses,
-  A bit should have broken or otherwise been rendered useless by 50,000 uses.

There are a few sources of variability that may not be obvious in this scenario:

-  The drill presses are similar but not identical,
-  The workers are all trained, but not identical,
-  The sheets of metal are similar, but not identical

<center> <h1> Your Goal </h1> </center>

Design an experiment that can be used to compare the lifetime of two brands which accounts for the sources of variability and can be performed inside of one week.

It is your choice 

-  what you measure and when, 

-  how (or if) you choose to apply randomization, blocking, etc. 

-  which available resources you choose to use.

There is no right and wrong way to do this, but thinking through this exercise you will hopefully get a better grasp of how all the parts of an experiement work together.
