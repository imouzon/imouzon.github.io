We described an ideal simple experiment and defined terms associated with one (2.3.1, 2.3.2)
-  response, managed variable, controlled variable, experimental variable, concomitant variable, extraneous variable, blocking variable, and randomization

We discussed the importance of **Comparative studies** (2.3.3)
-  there are many things that we can not control when we make measurements and collect data
-  when we want to compare a new method to a previous method, we need to be aware that the uncontrolled circumstances that existed when we studied the previous method do not exist anymore
-  in order to *know* that differences in results are the result of the method used (and not the difference in the circumstances) we must collect new data on both methods

### Dealing With Extraneous Variables

Some aspects of the environment can not be controlled, even though they may effect the results we see. We call those aspects **extraneous variables**.

Though we can not *control* extraneous variables, we can plan our experiment to minimize their impact (2.3.2, 2.3.4)

**Note**: These techniques are part of how the experiment is *designed* - we decide this before any data is collected.

**blocking** 

-  the process of arranging the experiment so that results from different methods are collected in similar environments

-  with blocking, we can compare methods in multiple environments

**randomization** 

-  the process of randomly assigning experimental units to experimental conditions *not already controlled by the specification of the supervised variables*

-  we hope to remove any pattern that the extraneous variables may have

-  Weight lifting example: 50 pound, 40 pound, 30 pound dumb bell, 100 lifts each, determining which is harder to lift by how much you strain

**Replication** 

-  the process of repeating a run of the experiment more than once

-  the results I get on the first run should be similar to the results I get on the second run

-  replication is strongly connected to the concept of reproducibility - the results I get should be similar to the results you get

### Summary

The main point is this: an effective experiment is **designed** to account for the environmental conditions that could influence our response.
Doing this takes a lot of planning.

## Recap
## Experimental Plans
### Completely Randomized
]
.right-column[
With **replication**, **randomization**, **blocking** we have introduced some common elements used in planning an experiment. 
Common combinations of these elements make up "skeleton" experiments around which we can build our real-life experiments.

**Completely Randomized Experiments**

-  All experimental variables are of primary interest (no controls, no blocking)

-  Randomization used at every possible point where we choose how to treat the experimental units

**Examples**

-  Example 12 (page 51): Golf ball drive distances study by G.Gronberg

   -  10 balls each at 3 different compressions (80, 90, and 100)

   -  How would you design an experiment to determine which type can be driven the furthest?

-  Example 13 (page 51-52): Pelletizing experiment

]
.right-column[
**Randomized Complete Block Experiments**

-  At least on factor is a blocking variable 

-  "Blocks" are created by combinations of the levels of the blocking variables

-  Within each block, every combination of the primary experimental variables are used at least once

-  Randomization is used where possible

**Examples**

-  Example 12 (page 51): Golf ball drive distances study by G.Gronberg

   -  Gronberg didn't drive the golf balls all at the same time 

   -  instead, he personally drove 10 golf balls from each compression each night, 6 nights a week, for 3 weeks.

**Randomized Incomplete Block Experiments**

-  At least on factor is a blocking variable 

-  "Blocks" are created by combinations of the levels of the blocking variables

-  Within each block, some combinations (but not all) of the primary experimental variables are used at least once while others are not used at all

-  Randomization is used where possible

**How does this work??**

-  There are some clever ways to assign the combinations of the primary experimental variable levels to the blocks that allow us to get "more" out of the data we collect.

-  How these block assignments come about gets explained in Chapter 8.

## Summarizing Univariate Data

**Exam Scores for Two Groups of Students Following Different Courses**

```
              Group 1             Group 2
            74 79 77 81         65 77 78 74
            68 79 81 76         76 73 71 71
            81 80 80 78         86 81 76 89
            88 83 79 91         79 78 77 76
            79 75 74 73         72 76 75 79    
```

Consider the data above, taken from two groups of creative writing students who were randomly assigned to one of two different 3-hour courses.
At the end of the courses, the students were given a standard creative writing test and their score on the test was recorded.

**The Use of Summaries**

Some questions are almost universal in analyzing the results of an experiment. 
For instance, in this specific case, we may ask:

-  Which group did better on average?
-  Where there any unusually low or high scores in either group?
-  Which group had the most scores over 80?
-  Ignoring high performers and low performers, which group is better?
-  Which group has the most consistent scores?
-  ...

```

Certain questions can and should be asked across many types of experiments.

But seeing data in this kind of *flat* format presents lots of problems for a person trying to understand the relationship between the two groups.

A set of tools, mainly mathematical and graphical, help researchers answer these questions by summarizing the data in a way that makes the answers to these questions obvious.

Good summaries should be quickly interpreted, provide clear insight into the data, and be widely applicable.

## Simple Graphical Summaries

Simple graphical summaries aim to provide a better view of the entire set of data.
The best graphs are able to make important points instantly and give valuable insights with closer study.
Producing good graphs is an [art](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/graphics/poster_OrigMinard.gif).

**Two common graphical summaries**

- Stem and Leaf Diagrams

- Dot Diagrams

## Frequency Tables

- **Class**: A grouping of the observations

- **Frequency**: The number of observations in a class

- **Relative Frequency**: The proportion of the observations in the class

- **Cumulative Relative Frequency**: The proportion of observations in the current class or a previous class.

** Histograms **

A graphical representation of a frequency table.

**Tips for useful frequency tables**

1.  Use equal class intervals 
2.  Use uniform scales on both axes (i.e., keep lengths consistent)
3.  Show the entire vertical axis (especially for relative frequency histograms)
