\textbf{Netflix recommendations}

A Recommender System is a statistical tool many websites use to recommend new items, products, or services to a user based on the user's history.
For example, the popular movie streaming service Netflix recommends movies a user might like by assigning a predicting a rating between 0 and 5 to movies the user has not previously rated on the site and recommending the movies with the highest predicted rating.
Netflix is testing a few changes in their recommendation system in an attempt to increase its accuracy.
A specific user's true ratings are recorded below as well as the predicted ratings from the current recommender system and the predicted ratings from the new recommender system:

\textbf{Chilling fluid}

The production of a certain type of metal beam involves rapidly cooling the beam to 10 degrees Celsius by submerging it in a bath of chilling fluid.
The time required to reduce the beams temperature should be short or the cooling process can cause problems on the production line.
During a single working week, six beams were randomly chosen and the time it took to cool them to 10 degrees Celsius is recorded below (in minutes):

\textbf{Coloring books}

Power4People (P4P), an electical utility company, has consulted with workplace psychologists to find ways to reduce the stress levels of their engineering employees.
The psychologists recommended two techniques: (1) practicing transcendental meditation and (2) spending time on simple arts and crafts projects.
P4P has asked one of their engineers, KW, to determine which (if either) of two techniques is most effective.
P4P's engineers belong to one of three departments: computing (22 engineers); electical (26 engineers); and construction (30 engineers).
It is believed that stress levels will be different for each department (for instance, the computer engineers travel less frequently).
The psychologists have created an exam that measures stress levels from 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest), with all scores between 0 and 100 possible.

After a little thought, KW comes up with the following plan:
18 engineers are randomly selected from each of the three departments. 
All the selected engineers take the exam to measure their stress level.
The 18 engineers selected from each department are then randomly split into three groups of six engineers each.
\begin{itemize}
   \item The first group will meet each morning from 10:00 to 10:30 to practice transcendental meditation,
   \item The second group will meet each morning from 10:00 to 10:30 to quietly color in the coloring books,
   \item The third group will have no adjustment to their work schedule.
\end{itemize}
After two weeks, the engineers are again given the exam to measure their stress level and the change in their stress level is recorded.

\textbf{Tidal torrents}

Within 24 hours of its release, The Life of Pablo, a new album by Kanye West, had been illegally downloaded over 500,000 times by people using BitTorrent,
a system in which users download a file to their own computers and upload the file to the computers of others.

For one hour, starting at 6:00 pm and continuing until 7:00 pm Eastern, 
a systems engineer working for the company that stands to lose money from the piracy used a combination of tools to gather the following information on every 
500th individual who began downloading a torrent of the album.

\begin{itemize}
   \item Whether the individual was in the United States or not,
   \item The individual's average upload speed,
   \item The individual's average download speed,
   \item The number of users the individual shared the album with,
\end{itemize}

Tidal plans to use the data gathered to illustrate the extent of their loss in future legal action.

   \part[2] After noticing that most of the users are from the United States, one executive comments that most Kanye West fans are Americans. 
            Another executive points out that most of Europe is asleep at 6:00 pm eastern and wouldn't be awake to download the album.
            In this case, whether or not a person is awake could be considered what kind of variable?

\textbf{Highlights}

The lifetime of a highlighter can be measured in the area of paper it can cover with highlighting fluid until either the marker falls apart or it runs out of highlighter fluid.
A sample of 26 highlighters were used until the end of their lifetime. The areas covered by the highlighters (in square meters) are recorded below:

\question

\textbf{Ultralight beams}

An ultralight beam is a type of metal beam used as secondary support in the facade of tall structures. 
Its low weight and high flexibility make it ideal for environments exposed to high amounts of pressure.

A manufacturer of ultralight beams performed the following analysis to illustrate the flexible nature of the beams.
26 ultralight beams were fixed in place vertically.
Each beam had a different amount of force applied to it, from 5 kN 55 kN, for 20 minutes in an attempt to bend the bar.
After the twenty minutes, the beam had a chance to ``bounce back" the final displacement from its original position was measured (in centi-radians).
The smaller the displacement, the better the bar did in returning to its original position.

The experiment was repeated, this time using the steel beams traditionally used as secondary support in the facade of tall buildings (referred to from here on as ``traditional beams").

%-- : R code (Code in Document)


The results are depicted below (with the force applied on the x-axis, and with ultralight beam observations represented with triangles and traditional beam results represented by dots):

\begin{center}

\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{figure/unnamed-chunk-9-1} 

\end{knitrout}
\end{center}

Here are some summaries of the ultralight data (again using the force applied as the x-value and the displacement of the beam as the y-value):

$$
   \sum_{i=1}^{50} x_i = 780 \hspace{3cm} \sum_{i=1}^{50} x_i^2 = 29250 \\
$$

$$
   \sum_{i=1}^{50} y_i = 319 \hspace{3cm} \sum_{i=1}^{50} y_i^2 = 4455 \\
$$

$$
   \sum_{i=1}^{50} x_i y_i = 11227
$$
