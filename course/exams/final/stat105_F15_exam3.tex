\question
Portable pneumatic pumps have long been used by hobby machinists, but are gaining renewed interest as robotics are becoming a more common part of our daily lives.
Specifically, drones can make use of such pumps due to their weight benefits over hydraulic pumps with equivalent strength.
Amazon is experimenting with using such pumps in its delivery drones and is interested in factors effecting the lifetime of the pumps.

A team of engineers working for Amazon has been tasked with developing pumps for delivery drones that improve both time-in-flight (measured in hours) and the number of pump-actions (the number of times the drone uses the pump).
With those goals in mind, the team designed three pumps: a single-piston/single-stage design, a dual-piston/single-stage design, and a dual-piston/dual-stage design.
The engineers are testing the pumps with three types of compressed gas: OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen), Carbon dioxide, and Oxygen.
Concerned about environmental effects, the engineers selected four locations to test the drones in - San Antonio, Seattle, Lexington, and Amherst in which to test the drones.

In all four locations they tested the every design-gas combination in five drones (45 drones in each location).
The drones delivered 5 pound packages from an initial location to a location 2000 meters away, retrieved the package, and returned it to the original point.
The number of deliveries and the flight time were recorded for each drone.

Note: \((\text{3 designs}) \cdot (\text{3 gas types}) \cdot (\text{5 drones}) \cdot (\text{4 locations}) = \text{180 total drones}\)

The goal is to determine is to identify how to maximize both flight time and number of deliveries.

\question

%-- : R code (Code in Document)


The quality of a diamond is often described in terms of the four C's:
carat (the diamonds mass, with 1 carat = 200 milligrams), 
cut (a description of how well the diamond has been shaped),
color (the less color the more rare),
clarity (a description of the flaws in the diamond).
Of these, carat is the most easily understood in terms of its impact on the diamonds value: 
all things being equal, the larger the diamond the higher its value.

The following plot shows the sale price of 375 diamonds (in thousands of dollars), which were appraised by experts as having an ideal cut, internally flawless clarity, and being colorless or essentially colorless.

 Consider the following scenario:

 A fair die is rolled and the number of dots facing up is counted.
 For each dot facing up on the die, a fair coin is flipped and the number of times the coin lands heads up is recorded.
 \begin{itemize}
    \item let $N$ be the number of dots facing up from the roll of the die
    \item let $X$ be the number of heads resulting from the flips of the coin.
 \end{itemize}

 Hint: if we roll a 5 then $N = 5$ and we will toss the coin 5 times. If we consider landing on heads to be a success, then we have the conditional distribution of $X | N = 5$ to be binomial(5, $0.5$).
 More generally, we can write:
 $$
 f_{X|N}(x|n) = \frac{n!}{(n - x)! x!} (0.5)^x (0.5)^{n - x}, x = 0, 1, ..., n

\question

An inspector examining the dependability of a certain gas pump fills 50 containers until the pump reads 1.00 gallons. 
If the pump is completely accurate, then each container should have 1.00 gallons of gasoline.
However, since nothing is completely consistent, there will be differences from one container to the next.

Suppose that it is known that the true standard deviation of the amount of gasoline the pump recognizes as 1.00 gallons is $\sigma = 0.2$ gallons.

The average of the 50 gallon samples is $\bar{x} = 0.992$ gallons

\part[4] Interpret these confidence intervals - is there evidence that the meter on the pump is not accurate?

% %    After running the O-ring experiment, the researchers found $\bar{x} = 50$ K and $\bar{y} = 53$ K.
