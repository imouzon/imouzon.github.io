### Tools

<!-- TO DO: instructions for downloading R -->
   Interactive tools and helpful links will be posted here.

## Programming 

### R
CRAN: The Comprehensive R Archive Network
-  CRAN and R are almost synonymous: they manage most of the package distribution
-  CRAN hosts the current version of R for download: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/) and most students will find this the simplest way to download and begin using R
-  RStudio is a popular GUI tool for R. It is the "bells and whistles" 
-  R has good package support on both Emacs (which I know nothing about) and Vim (which I love and would be more than happy to talk to you about). I imagine that it also has Sublime stuff.
